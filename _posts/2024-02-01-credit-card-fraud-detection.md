Built an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline using real-world transactional data.

### 🔍 Problem
Identify fraudulent transactions from highly imbalanced datasets.

### 🧰 Tools & Techniques
- Data preprocessing, EDA, feature scaling
- SMOTE for class balancing
- XGBoost, Random Forest, and Neural Networks
- Precision, Recall, F1-score evaluation
- MLflow tracking + FastAPI deployment

### 💡 Outcome
Achieved 0.91 F1-score. Deployed model using FastAPI, made cloud-ready with Docker and AWS EC2.
